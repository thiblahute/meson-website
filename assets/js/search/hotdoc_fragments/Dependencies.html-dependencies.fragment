Meson makes it very easy to find and use external dependencies. Here is how one would use the Zlib compression library. \nFirst Meson is told to find the external library zlib and error out if it is not found. The version keyword is optional and specifies a version requirement for the dependency. Then an executable is built using the specified dependency. Note how the user does not need to manually handle compiler or linker flags or deal with any other minutiae. \nIf you have multiple dependencies pass them as an array \nIf the dependency is optional you can tell Meson not to error out if the dependency is not found and then do further configuration. \nYou can pass the opt_dep variable to target construction functions whether the actual dependency was found or not. Meson will ignore non found dependencies. \nThe dependency detector works with all libraries that provide a pkg config file. Unfortunately several packages don t provide pkg config files. Meson has autodetection support for some of these. \n"});
