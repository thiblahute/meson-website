There are just two things to note. First you must tell GCC to link the C standard library statically. If you don t then your app is guaranteed to break as different distros have binary incompatible C libraries. The second thing is that you need to point your install prefix to some empty staging area. Here s the meson command to do that \nThe aim is to put the executable in tmp myapp bin and shared libraries to tmp myapp lib. The next thing you need is the embedder. It takes your dependencies in this case only libSDL2 so.0 and copies them in the lib directory. Depending on your use case you can either copy the files by hand or write a script that parses the output of ldd binary_file. Be sure not to copy system libraries libc libpthread libm etc For an example see the sample project. \nMake the script run during install with this \n"});
