Therefore Meson provides the tools to detect properties of the system during configure time. To get most of this information you first need to extract the compiler object from the main meson variable. \nHere we extract the C compiler. We could also have given the argument cpp to get the C compiler objc to get the objective C compiler and so on. The call is valid for all languages specified in the project declaration. Trying to obtain some other compiler will lead to an unrecoverable error. \n"});
