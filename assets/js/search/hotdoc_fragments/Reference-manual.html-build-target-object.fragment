To use the object file s in another build target use the objects keyword argument. \nextract_all_objects is same as above but returns all object files generated by this target \nprivate_dir_include returns a opaque value that works like include_directories but points to the private directory of this target usually only needed if an another target needs to access some generated internal headers of this target \nfull_path returns a full path pointing to the result target file \n"});
