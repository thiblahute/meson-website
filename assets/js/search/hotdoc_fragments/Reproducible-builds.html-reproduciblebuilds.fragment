This allows people to verify that binaries downloadable from the net actually come from the corresponding sources and have not for example had malware added to them. \nMeson aims to support reproducible builds out of the box with zero additional work assuming the rest of the build environment is set up for reproducibility If you ever find a case where this is not happening it is a bug. Please file an issue with as much information as possible and we ll get it fixed. \n"});
