A good description can be found on this page. Please read it and create a template image file according to its instructions. \nThe actual process of creating the installer is very simple you mount the template image copy your app bundle in it unmount it and convert the image into a compressed archive. The actual commands to do this are not particularly interesting feel free to steal them from either the linked page above or from the sample script in Meson s test suite. \n"});
