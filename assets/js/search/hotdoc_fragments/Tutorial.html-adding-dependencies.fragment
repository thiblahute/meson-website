Let s update our program to create a graphical window instead. We ll use the GTK widget toolkit. First we edit the main file to use Gtk. The new version looks like this. \nThen we edit the Meson file instructing it to find and use the Gtk libraries. \nNow we are ready to build. The thing to notice is that we do not need to recreate our build directory run any sort of magical commands or the like. Instead we just type the exact same command as if we were rebuilding our code without any build system changes. \nOnce you have set up your build directory the first time you don t ever need to run the meson command again. You always just run ninja. Meson will automatically detect when you have done changes to build definitions and will take care of everything so users don t have to care. In this case the following output is produced. \nNote how Meson noticed that the build definition has changed and reran itself automatically. The program is now ready to be run \nThis creates the following GUI application. \n\n"});
