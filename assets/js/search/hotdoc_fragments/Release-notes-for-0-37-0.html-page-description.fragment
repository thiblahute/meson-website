This is useful when linking to compiled assembly code or other code that does not have its C symbol mangling handled transparently by the compiler. \nC symbol mangling is platform and architecture dependent and a helper function is needed to detect it. Eg Windows bit prefixes underscore but bit does not. Linux does not prefix an underscore but OS X does. \nYou can now pass arguments to install scripts added with meson.add_install_script All arguments after the script name will be passed to the script. \nThe MESON_INSTALL_DESTDIR_PREFIX environment variable is now set when install scripts are called. This contains the values of the DESTDIR environment variable and the prefix option passed to Meson joined together. This is useful because both those are usually absolute paths and joining absolute paths in a cross platform way is tricky. os.path.join in Python will discard all previous path segments when it encounters an absolute path and simply concatenating them will not work on Windows where absolute paths begin with the drive letter. \n"});
