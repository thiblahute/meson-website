A typical source file has less than one thousand lines of code. In contrast the headers of large libraries can be tens of thousands of lines. This is especially problematic with C where header only libraries are common and they may contain extremely complex code. This makes them slow to compile. \nPrecompiled headers are a tool to mitigate this issue. Basically what they do is parse the headers and then serialize the compiler s internal state to disk. The downside of precompiled headers is that they are tricky to set up. Meson has native support for precompiled headers but using them takes a little work. \nA precompiled header file is relatively simple. It is a header file that contains include directives for the system headers to precompile. Here is a C example. \nIn Meson precompiled header files are always per target. That is the given precompiled header is used when compiling every single file in the target. Due to limitations of the underlying compilers this header file must not be in the same subdirectory as any of the source files. It is strongly recommended that you create a subdirectory called pch in the target directory and put the header files and nothing else there. \n"});
