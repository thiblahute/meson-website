fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Build-targets.html#build-targets", "fragment": "Build targets \nMeson provides three kinds of build targets executables static libraries and shared libraries. They are created with the commands executable static_library and shared_library respectively. All objects created in this way are immutable. That is you can not change any aspect of them after they have been constructed. This ensures that all information pertaining to a given build target is specified in one well defined place. \nAs an example here is how you would build a shared library. \nIn unix like operating systems shared libraries can be versioned. Meson supports this with keyword arguments. \nIt is common to build a library and then an executable that links against it. This is supported as well. \nMeson sets things up so that the resulting executable can be run directly from the build directory. There is no need to write shell scripts or set environment variables. \nOne target can have multiple language source files. \n"});
