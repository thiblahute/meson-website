fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Syntax.html#syntax", "fragment": "Syntax \nThe syntax of Meson s specification language has been kept as simple as possible. It is strongly typed so no object is ever converted to another under the covers. Variables have no visible type which makes Meson dynamically typed also known as duck typed \nThe main building blocks of the language are variables numbers booleans strings arrays function calls method calls if statements and includes. \nUsually one Meson statement takes just one line. There is no way to have multiple statements on one line as in e.g. C. Function and method calls argument lists can be split over multiple lines. Meson will autodetect this case and do the right thing. Apart from line ending whitespace has no syntactical meaning. \n"});
