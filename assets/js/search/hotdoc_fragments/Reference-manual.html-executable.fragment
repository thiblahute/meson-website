fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#executable", "fragment": "executable \nCreates a new executable. The first argument specifies its name and the remaining positional arguments define the source files to use. They can be of the following types \nThese source files can be sources objects libraries or any other file. Meson will automatically categorize them based on the extension and use them accordingly. For instance sources c cpp vala rs etc will be compiled objects o obj and libraries so dll etc will be linked and all other files headers unknown extensions etc will be ignored. Meson will still create a build time dependency on all source files which is useful with generated files. \nExecutable supports the following keyword arguments. Note that just like the positional arguments above these keyword arguments can also be passed to shared and static libraries. \nThe list of sources objects and dependencies is always flattened which means you can freely nest and add lists while creating the final list. As a corollary the best way to handle a disabled dependency is by assigning an empty list to it and passing it like any other dependency to the dependencies kwarg. \nThe returned object also has methods that are documented in the object methods section below. \n"});
