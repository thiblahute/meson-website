First you can run it directly from the source tree with the command path to source meson.py. Meson may also be installed in which case the command is simply meson. In this manual we only use the latter format for simplicity. \nAt the time of writing only a command line version of Meson is available. This means that Meson must be invoked using the terminal. If you wish to use the MSVC compiler you need to run Meson under Visual Studio command prompt \n"});
