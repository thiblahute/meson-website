The linked sample code does it by having two different scripts. This separates the different pieces generating the installer into logical pieces. \ninstall_script.sh only deals with embedding dependencies and fixing the library paths. \nbuild_osx_installer.sh sets up the build with the proper paths compiles installs and generates the dmg package. \nThe main reasoning here is that in order to build a complete OSX installer package from source all you need to do is to cd into the source tree and run build_osx_installer.sh. To build packages on other platforms you would write scripts such as build_windows_installer.bat and so on. \n"});
