When Autotools was designed in the late s Unix shell was available pretty much anywhere. This is no longer the case. \nIt is also the case that as any project gets larger sooner or later it requires code generation scripting or other tooling. This seems to be inevitable. Because there is no scripting language that would be available everywhere these tools either need to be rewritten for each platform which is a lot of work and is prone to errors or the project needs to take a dependency on something. \nAny project that uses Meson at least the current version can rely on the fact that Python will always be available because you can t compile the project without it. All tooling can then be done in Python with the knowledge that it will run on any platform without any extra dependencies modulo the usual porting work This reduces maintenance effort on multiplatform projects by a fair margin. \n"});
