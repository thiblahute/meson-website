fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#declare_dependency", "fragment": "declare_dependency \nThis function returns a dependency object that behaves like the return value of dependency but is internal to the current build. The main use case for this is in subprojects. This allows a subproject to easily specify how it should be used. This makes it interchangeable with the same dependency that is provided externally by the system. This function has three keyword arguments. \n"});
