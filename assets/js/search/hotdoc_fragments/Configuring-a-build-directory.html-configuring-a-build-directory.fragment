For example you might want to change from a debug build into a release build set custom compiler flags change the build options provided in your meson_options.txt file and so on. \nThe main tool for this is the mesonconf script. You may also use the mesongui graphical application if you want. However this document describes the use of the command line client. \nYou invoke mesonconf by giving it the location of your build dir. If omitted the current working directory is used instead. Here s a sample output for a simple project. \nThese are all the options available for the current project arranged into related groups. The first column in every field is the name of the option. To set an option you use the D option. For example changing the installation prefix from usr local to tmp testroot you would issue the following command. \nThen you would run your build command usually ninja which would cause Meson to detect that the build setup has changed and do all the work required to bring your build tree up to date. \n"});
