In addition there was a main C file that just called each function in turn. We then generated build system files for Meson CMake SCons Premake and Autotools that compiled these files into a single executable. \nWith this we measured three different things. The first is configuration time that is the time the build system takes to generate necessary build files. This is usually called the configure step. The time was measured in seconds. \nThe second thing to measure was the build time. This should be limited by the compiler and in the optimal case should be the same for every build system. Four parallel processes were used in this test. \nThe third thing we measured was the empty build time. This measures how much time the build system takes to check the states of all source files because if any of them could potentially cause a rebuild. \nSince CMake has two different backends Make and Ninja we ran the tests on both of them. All tests were run on a era Macbook Pro running Ubuntu The tests were run multiple times and we always took the fastest time. \nHere are the results for configuration time. \n\n"});
