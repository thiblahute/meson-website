fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Unit-tests.html#parallelism", "fragment": "Parallelism \nTo reduce test times Meson will by default run multiple unit tests in parallel. It is common to have some tests which can not be run in parallel because they require unique hold on some resource such as a file or a dbus name. You have to specify these tests with a keyword argument. \nMeson will then make sure that no other unit test is running at the same time. Non parallel tests take longer to run so it is recommended that you write your unit tests to be parallel executable whenever possible. \nBy default Meson uses as many concurrent processes as there are cores on the test machine. You can override this with the environment variable MESON_TESTTHREADS like this. \n"});
