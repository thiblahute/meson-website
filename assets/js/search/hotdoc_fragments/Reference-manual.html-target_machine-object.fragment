fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#target_machine-object", "fragment": "target_machine object \nProvides information about the target machine the machine on which the compiled binary s output will run. Hence this object should only be used while cross compiling a compiler. See Cross compilation. \nIt has the same methods as build_machine but note that it simply returns the values defined in the cross info file. If target_machine values are not defined in the cross info file host_machine values are returned instead. \n"});
