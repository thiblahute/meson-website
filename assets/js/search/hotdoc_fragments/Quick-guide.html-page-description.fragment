fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Quick-guide.html#page-description", "fragment": "Using Meson as a distro packager \nDistro packagers usually want total control on the build flags used. Meson supports this use case natively. The commands needed to build and install Meson projects are the following. \nThe command line switch buildtype plain tells Meson not to add its own flags to the command line. This gives the packager total control on used flags. \nThis is very similar to other build systems. The only difference is that the DESTDIR variable is passed as an environment variable rather than as an argument to ninja install. \nAs distro builds happen always from scratch we recommend you to enable unity builds whenever possible on your packages because they are faster and produce better code. \n"});
