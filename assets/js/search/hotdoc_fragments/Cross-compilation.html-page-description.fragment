You just have to specify which one to use. \nSometimes in cross compilation you need to build your own standard library instead of using the one provided by the compiler. Meson has built in support for switching standard libraries transparently. The invocation to use in your cross file is the following \nThis specifies that C standard library is provided in the Meson subproject mylibc in internal dependency variable mylibc_dep. It is used on every cross built C target in the entire source tree including subprojects and the standard library is disabled. The build definitions of these targets do not need any modification. \n"});
