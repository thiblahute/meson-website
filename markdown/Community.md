# Community

There are two main methods of connecting with other Meson developers. The first one is the mailing list, which is hosted at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mesonbuild).

The second way is via IRC. The channel to use is <tt>#mesonbuild</tt> at [Freenode](https://freenode.net/).
