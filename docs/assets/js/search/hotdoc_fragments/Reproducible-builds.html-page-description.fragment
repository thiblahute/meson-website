This allows people to verify that binaries downloadable from the net actually come from the corresponding sources and have not, for example, had malware added to them.</p>\n<p>Meson aims to support reproducible builds out of the box with zero additional work (assuming the rest of the build environment is set up for reproducibility). If you ever find a case where this is not happening, it is a bug. Please file an issue with as much information as possible and we'll get it fixed.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
