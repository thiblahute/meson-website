The only way to get this information is to run Meson under the Visual Studio Command Prompt. The steps to set it up are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on start menu and select \"Visual Studio 2015 Command Prompt\"</li>\n<li>cd into your source directory</li>\n<li>mkdir build</li>\n<li>python3 path/to/meson.py build --backend vs2015</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you wish to use the Ninja backend instead of vs2015, pass <code>--backend ninja</code>. At the time of writing the Ninja backend is more mature than the VS backend so you might want to use it for serious work.</p>\n<p>This assumes Python3 is in your <code>PATH</code>, which is highly recommended.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
