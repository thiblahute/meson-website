So is every second spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>multiplatform support for Linux, OSX, Windows, Gcc, Clang, Visual Studio and others</li>\n<li>supported languages include C, C++, Fortran, Java, Rust</li>\n<li>build definitions in a very readable and user friendly non-turing complete DSL</li>\n<li>cross compilation for many operating systems as well as bare metal</li>\n<li>optimized for extremely fast full and incremental builds without sacrificing correctness</li>\n<li>built-in multiplatform dependency provider that works together with distro packages</li>\n<li>fun!</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
