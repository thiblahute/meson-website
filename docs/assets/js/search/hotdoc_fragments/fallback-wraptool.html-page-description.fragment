It is not as slick and may have bugs but at least it will allow you to use wraps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-it\">Using it</h2>\n<p>Currently the emergency tool is only in Meson trunk so you need a git checkout to use it. It also does not on releases older than 0.32.0 because they had a bug. (A workaround for older versions is to delete existing <code>foobar.wrap</code> files if you have them.)</p>\n<p>To list all available wraps:</p>\n<pre><code>ghwt.py list\n</code></pre>\n<p>To install a wrap, go to your source root, make sure that the <code>subprojects</code> directory exists and run this command:</p>\n<pre><code>ghwt.py install &lt;projectname&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will stage the subproject ready to use. If you have multiple subprojects you need to download them all manually.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-upgrade-an-existing-dirfix-broken-stateany-other-problem\">How to upgrade an existing dir/fix broken state/any other problem</h2>\n<p>Nuke the contents of <code>subprojects</code> and start again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"known-issues\">Known issues</h2>\n<p>Some repositories show up in the list but are not installable. They would not show up in the real wrapdb because they are works in progress.</p>\n<p>Github web API limits the amount of queries you can do to 60/hour. If you exceed that you need to wait for the timer to reset.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
