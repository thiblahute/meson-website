It tries to do as many things automatically as it possibly can.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ccache\">CCache</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://ccache.samba.org/\">CCache</a> is a cache system designed to make compiling faster. When you run Meson for the first time for a given project, it checks if CCache is installed. If it is, Meson will use it automatically.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to use CCache for some reason, just specify your compiler with environment variables <code>CC</code> and/or <code>CXX</code> when first running Meson (remember that once specified the compiler can not be changed). Meson will then use the specified compiler without CCache.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coverage\">Coverage</h2>\n<p>When doing a code coverage build, Meson will check the existance of binaries <code>gcovr</code>, <code>lcov</code> and <code>genhtml</code>. If the first one is found, it will create targets called <em>coverage-text</em> and <em>coverage-xml</em>. If the latter two are found, it generates the target <em>coverage-html</em>. You can then generate coverage reports just by calling e.g. <code>ninja coverage-xml</code>.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
