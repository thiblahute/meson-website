There are two different ways of generating Pkg-config files in Meson. The first way is to build them manually with the <code>configure_files</code> command. The second way is to use Meson's built in Pkg-config file generator. The difference between the two is that the latter is very simple and meant for basic use cases. The former should be used when you need to provide a more customised solution.</p>\n<p>In this document we describe the simple generator approach. It is used in the following way.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-meson\">pkg = import('pkgconfig')\nlibs = ...     # the library/libraries users need to link against\nh = ['.', ...] # subdirectories of ${prefix}/${includedir} to add to header path\npkg.generate(libraries : libs,\n             subdirs : h,\n             version : '1.0',\n             name : 'libsimple',\n             filebase : 'simple',\n             description : 'A simple demo library.')\n</code></pre>\n<p>This causes a file called <code>simple.pc</code> to be created and placed into the install directory during the install phase.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
